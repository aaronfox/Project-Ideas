# Project-Ideas
A shortlist of projects I'm thinking of/currently working on

- **A mood/suicide watcher**: Over 38,000 Americans die by suicide every year. If there was an easier way to keep tabs on how people were doing in a non-instrusive manner, such as using the [Natural Lanuage Toolkit ](https://www.nltk.org/) to analyze someone's sentiment over time on their various social media accounts such as their Tweets, Instagram captions, or Facebook posts, it could be possible to find out who is currently in need and could encourage others to reach out to them.

- **School alarm clock**: A clock that all school systems use and adjust according to when there is a snow day or not a snow day.

- **Unity Games**
    - Replicate a better version of [this](http://osa.studio/passme/) game
    - Infinite Climber, similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/9xvwm6/just_a_quick_showcase_of_my_infinite_climber_im/)
    - Word game, similar to a scrambler found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/9z3fki/would_love_feedback_on_my_android_word_game/)
    - Tile Piecer-TOGETHER game, similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/ao37hn/i_just_released_my_first_mobile_game_piece/?st=JRVGP3XE&sh=f94193e4)
